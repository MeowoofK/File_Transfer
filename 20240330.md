More on MIPS: what is interlocked pipeline? \
In an interlocked pipeline, hardware is used to check for hazards between stages ( eg: does the next instruction need to read a register before the older instructions have commited?). Some of these hazards may result in deadlocks.

In a non interlocked pipeline, no hardware is used to check for hazards. The simplicity advantages is obvious. 
However, the burden of** checking for dependencies is left to the programmer/compiler**. If they fail to check for hazards, the program might use invalid data and even create a deadlock requiring a reboot
